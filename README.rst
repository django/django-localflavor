Django's "localflavor" packages offer additional functionality for particular
countries or cultures. For example, these might include form fields for your
country's postal codes, phone number formats or government ID numbers.

This code used to live in Django proper -- in ``django.contrib.localflavor``
-- but was separated into a standalone package in Django 1.5 to keep the
framework's core clean.

For a full list of available localflavors, see

django-localflavor can also be found on and installed from the Python
Package Index: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-localflavor
